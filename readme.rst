=============
Load Balancer
=============

This repository contains the code in C++ and Rust for a simple load balancer
based on the coding challenge `Build Your Own Load Balancer
<https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-load-balancer/>`_.

You will find the C++ implementation under the :code:`cpp` directory (`cpp
<./cpp/>`_) and the rust one under the :code:`rust` directory (`rust
<./rust/>`_). Slides for the presentation can be found under the :code:`slides`
together with some small code examples (`slides <./slides/>`_).
